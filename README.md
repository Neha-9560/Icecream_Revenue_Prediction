# Ice Cream Revenue Prediction

This project is part of my Artificial Intelligence & Generative AI Internship at YBI Foundation.  
It focuses on predicting revenue based on temperature data using a simple linear regression model.

## Problem Statement

The goal is to predict the revenue generated by an ice cream seller based on the temperature on a given day.  
Higher temperature generally means more ice cream sales — and we use machine learning to model this relationship.

## Steps Performed

1. **Data Collection** – Collected temperature and revenue data.
2. **Data Visualization** – Plotted data using scatter plots.
3. **Model Training** – Used linear regression to train the model.
4. **Prediction** – Predicted revenue for new temperature values.
5. **Evaluation** – Plotted regression line and tested accuracy.
